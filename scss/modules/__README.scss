//---------
// MODULES
//=========

//	A Module is a major, project-specific UI element that is constructed from smaller partials (Components, Patterns, and/or Themes) and directly written using presentational styles.

//	Module examples: A login form, a navigation menu, header / footer, or a user profile table.

//	Ideally, each Module will have a core mixin, that establishes the essence of the module. The core mixin will be named after the module and pluralized, when appropriate.
