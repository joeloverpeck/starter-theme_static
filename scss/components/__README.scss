// COMPONENTS
//===========

//	A Component is a smaller element that can be used in a stand-alone fashion or as a part of a Module.  

//	A Component is an element that is very often extended into a sub-type.  For example, a Button Component could be extended into a Disabled or Cancel subtype, or a Messaging Component could be extended into a Warning or Success subtype.

// A Component rule should be written as a class or placeholder and extended.
